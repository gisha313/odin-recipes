    <p>
        This <strong>Goulash</strong> recipe is a spicy way to dress up stew beef. It is spicy but not mouth-burning! It can be made with cheaper cuts of beef and will still turn out very tender. If the stew gets too thick, add a little water while cooking. Garnish with sour cream.

            Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in oil until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove onions and set them aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Coat beef cubes in spice mixture, and cook in the onion pot until brown on all sides. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return onions to the pot with beef; pour in water, tomato paste, garlic, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
