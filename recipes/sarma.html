    <p>
        For this satisfying <strong>Sarma</strong> dish, sour cabbage (sauerkraut) leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice and ground meat (usually pork). They are then sandwiched between two layers of sauerkraut and simmered to completion. This is the best stuffed sour cabbage recipe I've ever tried.
