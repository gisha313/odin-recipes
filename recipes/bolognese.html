    <ol>
        <li>
            Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve sauce over hot pasta.
