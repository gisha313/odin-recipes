# odin-recipes

This is a simple website using done using only HTML and the utmost basics of it.

It was made while following The Odin Project's Foundation course / road map. This simple website showing a few recipes of some of my favorite foods, using the most basic elements (paragraphs, headings, lists, images, links). It looks ugly but it's just the beginning.

While I'm making this simple website, it is also my first time using git, so if the commits don't make sense or there's too little or too many of them, it'll get better (hopefully). It's satisfying working with git, I feel like I'm doing an actual project, even though this is so far from it.
