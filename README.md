# odin-recipes

This is a simple HTML project done using the utmost basics of HTML. It was made while following The Odin Project's Foundation course / road map. It's a website listing some of the recipes I've found. It looks ugly but it's just the beginning.

While I'm making this simple website, it is also my first time using git, so if the commits don't make sense or there's too little or too many of them, I'm learning, it'll get better (hopefully).
